   2.2 Inside "myDir" create a directory "fileServer" and copy the fileServer files into that directory
   
   2.3 Inside "myDir" create a directory "base" and copy the distributed base files into that directory
   
   2.4 Inside "myDir" create a directory "apps"
   
   2.5 Inside "apps" create a directory "app-one" and copy the distributed app-one files into that directory
